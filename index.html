    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <p>
        Though it has been explored for decades in science fiction and philosophy, artificial intelligence (AI) 
        is quickly becoming a reality.<br><br>

    <p title="introduction">
        <mark>Artificial intelligence</mark> is the intelligence of machines or software, 
        as opposed to the intelligence of humans or animals. 
        It is a field of study in computer science which develops and studies intelligent machines.

    <p>
        AI covers some fascinating areas, from how we design intelligent machines to
        what our future might look like when these machines are more ubiquitous than humans.
        An example might be when Siri tells you when it will rain in your city today.

    <h3>What Do People Think Of AI?</h3>
    <p>
        When people are asked about AI, they usually think of Hollywood blockbusters like The Terminator.
        It’s not surprising that someone who has never heard nor seen any mention about artificial intelligence 
        before often conjures up images similar to movies such as The Terminator—something which most might 
        consider an accurate representation.
        They think we are at a point where AI applications can do all things for us—take care of our jobs,
        make decisions without consulting with humans, and so forth.

    <h3>What Is Artificial Intelligence?</h3>
    <p>
        Artificial intelligence involves using computers to do things that traditionally require human intelligence.
        But what exactly is it? And why are we so excited about it?
        Artificial intelligence is the science of making machines that can think like humans. It can do things that are considered "smart."
        AI technology can process large amounts of data in ways unlike humans. The goal for AI is to be able to do things such as recognize patterns, make decisions, and judge like humans. To do this, we need lots of data incorporated into them.
        AI technology is at the very foundation of some things, such as image recognition and classification. It's also changing how we make decisions— for example, it can be used to predict traffic light systems or when you get your coffee in the morning.
